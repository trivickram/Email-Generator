# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX: "Cannot find module 'express'" Error

## The Problem
Your Render deployment is failing with:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
```

This happens because Render is not properly finding the `package.json` and dependencies due to incorrect project structure configuration.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Use render.yaml (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Delete Current Render Service**:
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://render.com/dashboard)
   - Find your current service
   - Delete it

2. **Create New Service with render.yaml**:
   - Click "New" â†’ "Web Service"
   - Connect GitHub: `trivickram/Email-Generator`
   - **IMPORTANT**: When prompted, select "Use existing render.yaml file"
   - The render.yaml at repository root will handle everything correctly

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Deploy** - It should work now!

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create New Web Service**:
   - Connect GitHub: `trivickram/Email-Generator`
   - **Root Directory**: `web-app/backend`
   - Runtime: Node

2. **Build Command**:
   ```bash
   npm install && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start Command**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=10000
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   PYTHON_PATH=python3
   PYTHONPATH=./python
   ```

## Why This Happened

The error occurred because:
1. Render was looking for dependencies in the wrong directory
2. The build process wasn't finding `web-app/backend/package.json`
3. Therefore, `npm install` didn't run properly
4. Express and other dependencies weren't installed

## Verification

After fixing, you should see:
- âœ… Build logs showing "npm install" running successfully
- âœ… Service starting without module errors
- âœ… Health check at `/api/health` returning 200

## Need Help?

If this fix doesn't work:
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify your GitHub repository structure
3. Ensure all files are committed and pushed
4. See full DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed troubleshooting
